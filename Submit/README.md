# CS-112-Final-Project
2018 Spring Semester 

Group members: Fengling Hu, Martin Glusker, Andrea Kim, Caleb Winfrey

To compile: You will need to install JavaZoom (included as jl1.0.1.jar) into your Java Extensions folder. This jar file contains .class files. This is included in the file called "Downloads". Compile all files in terminal using javac for the files in the folder named "Java". Compile and run all files in the folder "Processing" in Processing (you will need to install the Minim package from the Processing library to run BeatListener.pde).

To run: Run Main method to open applet and run Music Player in Java. Click Open Music and choose a directory with at least one mp3 file in it (one mp3 is included in the zip). Run all Processing files in Processing (the mp3 file must be imported into Processing to be played).

Resources used: CustomPlayer.java is essentially copied from StackOverflow (credited in comments). The BeatListener method in the BeatListener class is copied directly from the BeatListener example on the Minim website (credited in comments). All other code was written.
